# AnonChat

A chat service written using Scala and Akka, using a DDD/Reactive approach.
An "anonymous chat service" was chosen, because it is a domain that allows for a good deal of flexibility
and experimentation.

Written from scratch using Aka typed Actors, by browsing
through the Akka documentation and picking out features that I wanted to test out.
